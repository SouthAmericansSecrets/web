<blockquote>“It could be about 10 years of reserves, maybe 20, and then it will be totally exhausted”<span><b>Victor Ropón</b></span></blockquote>
<p>“It could be about 10 years of reserves, maybe 20, and then it will be totally exhausted” , Ropón laments, referring to fears that the seabird population is doomed to drastically decrease in the coming years. It's a small miracle that the islands still have guano reserves, thanks to a century's effort praised by biologists as a rare example of sustainable exploitation of the resource. As the debate over whether global oil production has peaked continues, the story of guano could offer a parable, with maritime treachery, development of synthetic alternatives in Europe and in the desperate effort to avoid deposits when they were exhausted.</p>
<blockquote>“Before there was oil, there was guano, and of course wars were unleashed to control it"<span><b>Pablo Arriola</b><br />Director of Proabonos</span></blockquote>
<p>“Before there was oil, there was guano, and of course wars were unleashed to control it” says Pablo Arriola, director of Proabonos, the state company that controls the production of guano, in response to conflicts such as the War of the Chincha Islands when Peru prevented Spain regaining control over guano-producing islands. "Guano is a highly desirable business". It's also an undeniably grueling undertaking from the perspective of workers who migrate annually to the island to collect it. Day laborers rise before dawn to dig the hardened guano with shovels and hoes.</p>

<blockquote>“It's not an easy life, but I chose it”<span><b>Bruno Sulca</b><br />Guano Collection Supervisor</span></blockquote>
<p>Many go barefoot, and when they change shifts, shortly after noon, their feet and calves are covered in manure. Some cover their mouth and nose with cloth to avoid breathing the guano dust which, fortunately, is almost odorless, apart from a slight ammonia odor. "It's not an easy life, but I chose it" says Bruno Sulca, 62, supervising the loading of bags of Guañape guano from the island off the north coast of Peru. Sulca and other workers earn about 400 euros per month, more than triple what they pay manual workers in impoverished mountainous areas.</p>

<blockquote>“The problem is there is not enough to meet demand, now that new products as organic bananas compete for what is available.”<span><b>Enrique Balmaceda</b><br />Organic mango producer</span></blockquote>
<p>The guano trade in Peru, quixotically, remains after being nearly depleted by over-exploitation. It is unlikely to ever boom again as compared to the nineteenth century, when deposits were 50 feet thick and export earnings accounted for most of the national budget. On most islands, including Asia, located south of the capital, Lima, guano reaches less than 30 inches. But that which remains here is coveted when viewed in the context of the frenzy in Peru and abroad caused by synthetic fertilizers like urea, whose price has doubled in the last year.</p>
<p>“Guano has the advantage of being free from artificial chemicals” , explains Enrique Balmaceda, producer of organic mangoes in Piura, a northern province of Peru. "The problem is there is not enough to meet demand, now that new products as organic bananas compete for what is available."</p>
