<h1>Saving Chankillo</h1>
<p class="attribution">continued from <a href="./">page 1</a></p>
<p class="snippet">In 2011, physicist, science writer and professor at the University of Manchester, Brian Cox, visited the monumental complex and the Temple of the Thirteen Towers documentary miniseries for the BBC, Wonders of the Universe.</p>
<h2>Prisoners of Inaction</h2>
<blockquote>“Justice Ministry officials came to … talk with us to see if it was feasible to grant land … and I said no because it has a valuable archaeological site … suspiciously a few hours later they released a certificate of non-existence of archaeological remains …”</blockquote>
<p>In 2008, the former National Institute of Culture declared that the Chankillo Observatory was a cultural heritage site of the nation. In 2010 a project was initiated  with donations of just over $ 1 million from private companies and the World Monuments Fund in partnership with the regional government of Ancash. In 2013 the UNESCO included the archaeological complex of Chankillo as a candidate for World Heritage.</p>
<p>Despite all this, in September 2013 it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice announced the construction of a prison in the area between 365 to 369 kilometers, almost on the edge of the archaeological complex Chankillo (between 363 km and 365 km of the Panamerican North highway).</p>
<p>“In September, Justice Ministry officials came to Casma to talk with us to see if it was feasible to grant land between 364 and 369 kilometers of track and I said no because it has a valuable archaeological site for Casmeños, suspiciously a few hours later they released a certificate of non-existence of archaeological remains issued by the INC, without even having visited Chankillo, in the name of supporting Casma” said the mayor of Casma, Rommel Meza Cerna.</p>
<p>Meza Cerna said he has officially asked the Ministry of Justice to find another place outside his province where they can build their mega-prison which will host over eight thousand inmates.<p>
