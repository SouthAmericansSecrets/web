<h1>Saving Chankillo</h1>
<p class="attribution">continued from <a href="p2.shtml">page 2</a></p>
<p class="snippet">“Building the prison will bring invasions of families of prisoners as has occurred in other parts of the country”, said the Chamber of Tourism Casma Basin. “That would be a great social problem, moreover, in some cases, children, cousins, siblings of thugs also engage in illegal activities”, underlined in press release.</p>
<p>Meza Cerna Mayor has asked the Ministry of Justice to move the prison, which has a budget of 263 million soles, to another place, away from Casma. Moreover, being a criminal prison for inmates of other jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote>“Let them build a university or hospital which we need in Casma”</blockquote>
<p>“Let them build a university or hospital which we need in Casma. But a prison is a blunder of the government of Ollanta Humala. Chankillo's cultural heritage is of Peru and will soon be cultural heritage of the world”, said Meza Cerna.</p>

<p>Luis Vidales Ruíz, director of the Cambio Puende de Chimbote prison, revealed that the high-security prison that the Ministry of Justice wants to build in Casma, will serve to “decentralize chimbotano criminals, and will accommodate 3,168 inmates”.</p>
<p>The construction of this prison will not only affect the oldest solar observatory in the Americas, but also the ancient "Inca roads" related to the archaeological site of Aldas and the archaeological circuit Sechin. Therefore, the Casma Basin Chamber of Tourism (CATUC CASMA), in coordination with the Broad Front of Casma, are conducting a series of uprisings and protests, as the provincial unemployment that was convened on 12 February in protest at prison.</p>
<blockquote>“The Chankillo site is comparable to the geoglyphs of Nasca … if it achieves the title of World Heritage of UNESCO, it will be a magnet for tourism …”</blockquote>
<p>More than 15,000 protesters, including union leaders, businessmen, entrepreneurs, students, workers and carriers, took to the streets to protest the construction of mega-jail in Chankillo archaeological site.</p>
<p>“The Chankillo site is comparable to the geoglyphs of Nasca” says Ghezzi, “today it receives over 2000 visitors a year, but if it achieves the title of World Heritage of UNESCO, it will be a magnet for tourism and development in the province of Casma”.</p>
<p>That is, if the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Justice do not destroy it before. The casmeños have announced that they will continue to mobilize in defense of their heritage, which is also Peru's heritage.</p>
<p><b>Editor's Note</b></p>
<p>As of today, Chankillo still resides on Unesco's <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5792/" target="_blank">tentative list</a>
    and has remained that way since January 18th, 2014. While the process drags on, the power-brokers in Peru's government have time
    to cram in a mega-prison project that encroaches on the lands surrounding the America's oldest and world's best preserved
    solar observatory that still functions today. The site's surrounding areas still have much archaeological history hidden
    in the dirt and ancient roads leading to it that will be bulldozed away in a matter of months if UNESCO doesn't act soon
    to declare the Chankillo a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Not to mention the blight that importing a criminal population of over 8,000 inmates to the Casma will bring as has been
    seen in other areas of Peru. To understand how this mega-prison will affect Casma, one needs to know a little bit about
    Peruvian culture. Peruvian law permits squatters to occupy "undeveloped" land and criminal elements often exploit this law
    to invade lands. The exportation of prisoners to Casma from other parts of Peru will draw poorer families of prisoners to Casma
    who may likely invade lands to create homes close to their incarcerated loved ones as has been seen where other
    prisons have been built in other areas of Peru.</p>
<p>Statistically, family members of criminals have a higher probability of being criminals themselves. Worse is the turmoil exterted
    on family members when a loved one is incarcerated and exported to another region which uproots the family and is especially
    traumatic for the children of incarcerated parents, innocent victims of "justice".</p>
<p>Mega-prisons excel only at making profits for corporations and not at saving tax-payer money as lobbyists will insist.
    They destroy families and negatively impact the areas where they are located. Prisoners should not be torn away from their
    families and exported to profit-prisons. In the case of Casma, nor should they destroy valuable archaeological world history</p>
<p>You can help by appealing to UNESCO to move Chankillo from the tentative list to full-fledged status:
