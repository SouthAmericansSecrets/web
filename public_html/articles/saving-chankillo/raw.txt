<p class="snippet">Few know that Peru hosts the oldest and best preserved solar observatory in the Americas. It is a unique circular construction which was raised more than 2000 years ago on the Peruvian coast and is now threatened by the construction of a high-security prison to be built nearby.
<p>The monumental complex, named Chankillo, is a fortress which has a 13 solar observatory towers. It is located between km 363 and 365 of the Panamerican highway in the province of Casma, Ancash department, only 400 miles north of Lima, the capital of Peru.</p>

<p>Since 2001, the Peruvian archaeologist Ivan Ghezzi began his research in the deserts of Casma, specifically in the area where the enigmatic towers of Chankillo rise, a circular fortress with stone walls, built on a small hill that has already drawn scholarly attention from the likes of Julio C. Tello, Rosa Fung (and her husband John) and Theresa Topic.</p>
<p>The experts agreed to identify the 'Temple of the Thirteen Towers' as a solar observatory. The findings convinced one of the most respected figures in world archaeoastronomy, Clive Ruggles of England, famous for his research on Stonehenge, who organized a trip to Peru for the observatory.</p>

<p>In 2005, peruvian archaeologist Ivan Ghezzi and archaeoastronomist Clive Ruggles were interned in the desert near Casma with a GPS and the latest equipment to install a sophisticated compass-inclinometer in the vicinity of Chankillo and after study confirmed the news to the world: indeed it was a solar observatory built over 2,300 years ago by the civilization that occupied the middle valley of Casma. That made ​Chankillo the oldest solar observatory in the Americas.</p>
<p>In March 2007, the prestigious journal <i>Science</i>, <i>Yale University</i> and one of the major news networks, <i>BBC</i>, published stories that went around the world on finding.</p>

<p class="snippet">In 2011, physicist, science writer and professor at the University of Manchester, Brian Cox, visited the monumental complex and the Temple of the Thirteen Towers documentary miniseries for the BBC, Wonders of the Universe.</p>
<h2>Prisoners of Inaction</h2>
<p>In 2008, the former National Institute of Culture declared that the Chankillo Observatory was a cultural heritage site of the nation. In 2010 a project was initiated  with donations of just over $ 1 million from private companies and the World Monuments Fund in partnership with the regional government of Ancash. In 2013 the UNESCO included the archaeological complex of Chankillo as a candidate for World Heritage.</p>
<p>Despite all this, in September 2013 it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice announced the construction of a prison in the area between 365 to 369 kilometers, almost on the edge of the archaeological complex Chankillo (between 363 km and 365 km of the Panamerican North highway).</p>
<p>"In September, Justice Ministry officials came to Casma to talk with us to see if it was feasible to grant land between 364 and 369 kilometers of track and I said no because it had a valuable archaeological site for Casmeños, then suspiciously a few hours later they released a certificate of non-existence of archaeological remains issued by the INC, without even having visited Chankillo, in the name of supporting Casma" said the mayor of Casma, Rommel Meza Cerna.</p>
<p>Meza Cerna said he has officially asked the Ministry of Justice to find another place outside his province where they can build their mega-prison which will host over eight thousand inmates.<p>

<p>"Building the prison will bring invasions of families of prisoners as has occurred in other parts of the country", said the Chamber of Tourism Casma Basin (CATUC CASMA). "That would be a great social problem, moreover, in some cases, children, cousins, siblings of thugs also engage in illegal activities," underlined in press release.</p>
<p>Meza Cerna Mayor has asked the Ministry of Justice to move the prison, which has a budget of 263 million soles, to another place, away from Casma. Moreover, being a criminal prison for inmates of other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"Let them build a university or hospital which we need in Casma. But a prison is a blunder of the government of Ollanta Humala. Chankillo's cultural heritage is of Peru and will soon be cultural heritage of the world." said Meza Cerna.</p>

<p>Luis Vidales Ruíz, director of the Cambio Puende de Chimbote prison, revealed that the high-security prison that the Ministry of Justice wants to build in Casma, will serve to "decentralize chimbotano criminals, and will accommodate 3,168 inmates."</p>
<p>The construction of this prison will not only affect the oldest solar observatory in the Americas, but also the ancient "Inca roads" related to the archaeological site of Aldas and the archaeological circuit Sechin. Therefore, the Casma Basin Chamber of Tourism (CATUC CASMA), in coordination with the Broad Front of Casma, are conducting a series of uprisings and protests, as the provincial unemployment that was convened on 12 February in protest at prison.</p>
<p>More than 15,000 protesters, including union leaders, businessmen, entrepreneurs, students, workers and carriers, took to the streets to protest the construction of megapenal in Chankillo archaeological site.</p>
<p>"The Chankillo site is comparable to the geoglyphs of Nasca" says Ghezzi, "today it receives over 2000 visitors a year, but if it achieves the title of World Heritage of UNESCO, it will be a magnet for tourism development province of Casma."</p>
<p>That is, if the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Justice do not destroy it before. The casmeños have announced that they will continue to mobilize in defense of their heritage, which is the country's.</p>
