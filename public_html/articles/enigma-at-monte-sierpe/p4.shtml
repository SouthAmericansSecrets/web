<h1>Enigmas of Monte Sierpe and Nazca</h1>
<p class="attribution">continued from <a href="p3.shtml">page 3</a></p>
<p class="snippet">The view is spectacular, amongst the other mountain peaks we survey the valley and the enormity of the serpent's long body. It is the time for repose and we imagine ourselves standing in the same place where ancients once stood contemplating their monument they had built with their own hands.</p>
<blockquote>“what appears to be a serpent is actually the ancient deity Q'hoa. He was the servant … of the god of water … and was used in … rituals regarding rain”</blockquote>
<p>It is here that Lucio fills in some of the pieces of the puzzle for us: "I believe that what appears to be a serpent is actually the ancient deity Q'hoa. He was the servant or acolyte of the god of water known as Illapa and his likeness was used in a majority of rituals regarding rain”.</p>

<p>Historically, we know that many civilizations in Peru thrived and perished based on the changing climate on the periphery of the Atacama desert. Many deserts, especially the Atacama, are able to lock in their mineral wealth due to extreme aridity and with rain become highly fertile for farming. And while our modern climate science has unraveled the workings of smaller climate cycles such as the El Niño oscillation, the longer climate cycles are beyond our history of climate record-keeping. It appears that areas in Peru may have been fertile for hundreds of years, then suffered drought for hundreds of years after.</p>

<blockquote>“He took many forms but he is consistently depicted with a body comprising of concentric circles that represent water"</blockquote>
<p>Lucio continues describing Q'hoa: “He took many forms but he is consistently depicted with a body comprising of concentric circles that represent water or water-drops. His urination were the rains that brought life-giving water to the farmers. While his face is often that of a feline, his body was made long and serpent-like, sometimes a tribute to rainbows, other times a tribute to rivers that engorged after the rains he brought. In some depictions he had wings and legs and much later on he took the form of an eagle”.</p>
<blockquote>“Civilizations may come to an end but people and cultures simply do not just disappear"</blockquote>
<img src="/imgs/qhoa_2_t.jpg" width="304" height="171" alt="illustrated representation of Q'hoa" />
<p>Cultures of several ages worshipped Q'hoa and rituals in his favor were made often in pleas for the rains to come and end droughts. “Civilizations may come to an end but people and cultures simply do not just disappear". As Lucio contends, throughout many periods in Peru, a culture we know little about today, known as the Chavín, assimilated other cultures through religion. </p>
<blockquote>“Human survival and success demands that we seek greener pastures”</blockquote>
<img src="/imgs/qhoa_3_t.jpg" width="304" height="171" alt="textile representating Illapa and Q'hoa" />
<p>Lucio explains their ability to assimilate with a smile: “their success in assimilating neighboring cultures was their powerful religious figures and San Pedro". San Pedro is a hallucinegic cactus that, no doubt, the Chavín used to convince their neighboring cultures in the existence of their deities. The Chavín introduced and popularized the gods Q'hoa and Illapa and rituals in their name to their neighbors.</p>

<p>This early culture not only brought gods and rituals to new areas, they brought their technology as experts of the day in controlling water. They built canals around their temples and buildings to protect them from the regular El Niño floods which are known to be very powerful in Peru. But for reasons that remain unclear, the influence of the Chavín declined as new civilizations sprang forth.</p>
<p>“Human survival and success demands that we seek greener pastures. Even today we see peoples in depressed areas migrating to lands where there is greater prosperity and the chance of greater success". Lucio's analogy explains the apparent disintegration of the Chavín culture as the Paracas culture came into being.</p>
<p>“While they started out as humble fishermen, the Paracenses later on became great farmers during a period when their lands were fertile and humid. They would dig great canals in locations where the water table was high, just deep enough so that the roots of plants could reach water. During their reign they discovered cotton and textiles and forged trading routes with the highland peoples near them who were also learning to domesticate Vicuña whose fur could also be used in textile making”.</p>

<p>As the Chavín culture gave way to the Paracas culture, so too did Paracas give way to Nazca culture which perfected irrigation and water management for farming. They built great aqueducts that moved water in vast quantities from the river valley to the surrounding plains (probably in response to drought) and they perfected textile craftsmanship and pottery-making. But this great civilization was destined for a great suffering - a climate shift appears to have run the rivers dry:</p>
