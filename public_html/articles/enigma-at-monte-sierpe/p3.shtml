<h1>Enigmas of Monte Sierpe and Nazca</h1>
<p class="attribution">continued from <a href="p2.shtml">page 2</a></p>
<p class="snippet">“With thousands and thousands of such ritual sites our government is forced to choose which can be preserved and which cannot - this is why it is vital that we reveal this enigma's true significance. You can still find artifacts like pottery and other unusual items but already so much archaeological information has been looted, please let us leave what remains in their place”.</p>
<p>Respectfully we regard Lucio's plea and resist the urge to make souvenirs of artefacts we find like the child's jaw bone and what appears to be a female adult skull. We press on along a ridge between two valleys following these strange holes, every once-in-a-while stopping to observe their construction. We find they range in diameter around one meter and a depth of 80cm on average. They are lined with rocks carefully stacked such that they have lasted the ages.</p>

<blockquote>“the head of the serpent … only becomes clear from a certain point and certain time of day”</blockquote>
<p>The walk up the ridge is strenuous and testament to the monumental human effort that went into excavating and rock-lining well over five thousand holes that meander up this mountain ridge - tough rocky terrain. We are relieved to reach the plateau before the summit and take a few minutes to hydrate and reflect on the human toil that must have been required to complete such an undertaking.</p>

<p>But before we've had time to atrophy in contemplation, Lucio instructs us to observe the biology of what otherwise seems to be a completely desolate terrain. He shows us a lichen colony thriving on the rocks isolated to this nearby area. Finally the strangest flower blooming, seemingly out of nowhere, at the finality of the holes before the summit. Having past two kilometers of sheer dry desert terrain it is hard to comprehend how this flower blooms where it is.</p>

<p>From the flower's vantage is where we can distinguish the serpents head carved from the summit which had not been clear from our vantage point on the ridge plateau. “Many people miss the head of the serpent - it only becomes clear from a certain point and certain time of day when the shadows give it dimension” explains Lucio.</p>
<p>But even from the height of the ridge plateau we can not make out the entirety of the serpent's body as it meanders over ridge and hill and along valleys. For that, Lucio informs us, we must hike the summit. Although the incline changes dramatically, the rocks seem to make easy steps and we hit the top thirsty but in great spirits.</p>
