<h1>Enigmas of Monte Sierpe and Nazca</h1>

<blockquote>“The town [Monte Sierpe] was destroyed by the earthquake, not a single building was left standing”</blockquote>
<p class="snippet">Backtracking our route from Tambo Colorado just a few minutes we arrive to Monte Sierpe we find a small town rocked by earthquake in 2007. “The town was destroyed by the earthquake, not a single building was left standing” explains Lucio as he points out the town's former church, partially erect and invoking the strangest of feelings within us.</p>

<blockquote> The name <i>'Avenida de los Hoyos'</i> was coined by Peru's famous archaeologist Federico Kaufman Doig when he studied the site in the 1930's</blockquote>
<p>Our hike begins along irrigation canals then within a few hundred meters we arrive at the foot the <i>Picaduras de Viruela</i>. “This name [Picaduras de Viruela] is terrible - it was adapted by the locals in the 1930's when the holes were discovered by plane and those who discovered it offered the name only by virtue of the glyph's physical aspects and nothing of it's history. We hope to discover it's true name or offer another with respect to the original creators' intent. Otherwise we can settle with Avenida de los Hoyos”.</p>
<p>We find two large rock-lined excavations, similar to those at Tambo Colorado, at the base of the geoglyph. They are still littered with human remains, skulls and bones mostly. The 'tombs' are crudely constructed similar to those we have seen in Tambo Colorado and we are inclined to accept Lucio's conclusion that they are likely pre-Inca as the style of construction resembles nothing of the fine stonework during the Inca period.</p>

<p>One of our crew remarks how odd it is that these bones still lie here strewn about without being catalogued and open for anyone to loot. Lucio helps us understand the urgency of revealing the wonder at Monte Sierpe's true nature: "Peru is full of ancient burial and ritual sites - especially near the coast where the climate is particularly dry and preserves them”.</p>
