<h1>Enigmas of Monte Sierpe and Nazca</h1>
<p class="attribution">continued from <a href="p4.shtml">page 4</a></p>
<blockquote>“Nanazca is a word in Quechua which means pain or suffering”</blockquote>
<p>“Nanazca is a word in Quechua which means pain or suffering. It seems certain this period, the area, and the civilization itself [Nazca] was later named after this great decline”. Lucio's insights into cultural history help us understand their urgency for water and their inclination to appeal to their gods for help. Estimates of the building of the Nazca aqueducts occur during the third or fourth phase of their culture. It seems likely their construction were in response to a great drought.</p>
<p>“I believe that the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe was created during the drought that ended the Nazca civilization - clearly there is the motive. And if we study the shape of the figure we can see strong commonalities with other representations of Q'hoa - the concentric circles representing water or rain, the long body terminating in a head with mouth agape”. Lucio's explanation has convinced us and although the details of the serpent's head are far to weathered to make out the signature feline head found in other representations, the long body and concentric circles are Q'hoa's trademark.</p>
<p>But significance of the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe, as Lucio explains, does not end there: “This geoglyph may be proof that the Nazca civilization believed it could speak and appeal to the heavens using great marks on the earth”. Like castaways on a deserted island forming 'S.0.S.' on the beach to signal passing planes, it is feasible to think that these early cultures might have believed it possible to communicate with the heavens and clouds (their gods) through geoglyphs. And if this notion is acceptable, then the geoglyphs at Nazca may have been part of the same appeal.</p>
<p>“While the Nazca lines and other various geoglyphs in the surrounding region do not necessarily represent Q'hoa, they do certainly represent animals, humans, and life - what might be appeals to the gods to bring rain to bring life to the land. If we consider Kaufman Doig, then the Nazca monkey is also a representation of Q'hoa”.</p>
