 <h1>Nasca Lines from Pisco</h1>
 <p class="attribution">by <a rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/113422151487369565625">Rein Petersen</a> - February 26, 2014</p>
 <blockquote>“Before, the only way to see the Nasca lines was to travel to Nasca - usually by bus. But now we fly from Pisco and people prefer it.”<span><b>Lucio</b> - veteran guide</span></blockquote>
 <h2>*New* Nasca lines tours with regular flights from Pisco's renovated airport</h2>
 <p class="snippet">Getting to Nasca to see the Nasca lines once used to be a complicated and time-consuming effort. Unless you chartered your own private flight from Lima, public access was limited to mostly car or bus which is very long (7-8 hour one-way) trip from Lima.</p>
 <p>“The common sentiment related to us by visitors to Nasca Lines has been one of frustration that so much time is wasted travelling to experience a tour that lasts less than an hour” explains Lucio - a veteran Peru guide of more than 20 years.</p>
 <p>While the enigma that is the Nasca Lines is so very powerful, for travellers it comes down to the reality of how they want to spend their precious vacation time - enjoying that time replete with wonders and activities or crammed into buses for long durations.</p>
 <p>Thankfully the enigmatic Nasca Lines are now available to those on limited time. Lucio continues, “flying from Pisco's new airport is so much easier. The airport is a 5 minute drive from Paracas or a 20 minute flight from Lima - you save a whole day of traveling that you can use to enjoy all the other great things that Paracas has to offer.”</p>
