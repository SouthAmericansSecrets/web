  <h2>Afamado en la revista National Geographic, el Tambopata Research Center es, probablemente, los albergues en la selva más remotas de América del Sur y ofrece aventureros una experiencia auténtica en la selva peruana.</h2>
  <p class="snippet">El río Tambopata es uno de los hábitat exclusivo de las aves y los mamíferos. La flora en la reserva nacional es bastante típico del suroeste de la Cuenca Amazónica. El río Heath y llanuras de los alrededores son un ecosistema único en el Perú. Las pampas se inundan periódicamente, y los pequeños bosques de árboles con variada vida vegetal crecen en grupos aislados en la llanura.</p>
  <p>Si usted está buscando una experiencia más en profundidad del Amazonas, el Centro de Investigaciones Tambopata le convenga. Después de pasar la primera noche en el Refugio Amazonas, llega a la más grande collpa de guacamayos conocida en el segundo día de su viaje y explorar los senderos del Centro de Investigación de Tambopata en el corazón de la Reserva Nacional Tambopata.</p>

<ul><div>Day 1</div>
 <li>Arrival & Reception by Guide Our guides are biologists, tourism professionals, or community members.
  <div>Unless noted otherwise, our guides speak English. We assign guides at 6:1 ratio in Tambopata Research Center. This means groups smaller than 6 people will be merged with other groups under one guide. If you would like a private guide or a guide in a language other than English please let us know.</div></li>

 <li>Transfer Airport to Puerto Maldonado Headquarters Upon arrival from Lima or Cusco
  <div>We will welcome you at the airport and drive you ten minutes to our Puerto Maldonado headquarters. While enjoying your first taste of the forest in our gardens we will ask you to pack only the necessary gear for your next few days, and leave the rest at our safe deposit. This helps us keep the boats and cargo light</div></li>
  
 <li>Transfer Pto Maldonado Headquarters to Tambopata River Port Skirting Puerto Maldonado
  <div>We drive 20 kilometers to the Tambopata River Port, entering the Native Community of Infierno. The port is a communal business.</div></li>

 <li>Transfer Boat - Tambopata River Port to Refugio Amazonas
  <div>The two and a half hour boat ride from the Tambopata Port to Refugio Amazonas will take us past the Community of Infierno and the Tambopata National Reserve´s checkpoint and into the buffer zone of this 1.3 million hectare conservation unit</div></li>

 <li>Boxed Lunch</li>

 <li>Orientation Upon arrival
  <div>The lodge manager will welcome you and brief you with important navigation and security tips</div></li>

 <li>Dinner</li>

 <li>Caiman Search
  <div>We will be out at the river’s edge at night, scanning the shores with headlamps and flashlights to catch the red gleams of reflection from caiman eyes</div>
 </li>

<li>Overnight at Refugio Amazonas</li>
</ul>

<ul><div>Day 2</div>
 <li>Breakfast</li>
 <li>Canopy Tower A 
  <div>Thirty minute walk from Refugio Amazonas leads to the 25 meter scaffolding canopy tower. A bannistered staircase running through the middle provides safe access to the platforms above. The tower has been built upon high ground, therefore increasing your horizon of the continuous primary forest extending out towards the Tambopata National Reserve. From here views of mixed species canopy flocks as well as toucans, macaws and raptors are likely</div></li>
 <li>Oxbow Lake Visit
  <div>We will paddle around the lake on a canoe or a catamaran, looking for lakeside wildlife such as hoatzin, caiman and hornerd screamers, hoping to see the otters which are infrequently seen here. You will also be rewarded with overhead sightings of macaws.</div></li>

 <li>Transfer Boat
  <div>Refugio Amazonas to TRC Four and half hours by boat from Refugio Amazonas, in the pristine heart of the reserve, lies the Tambopata Research Center. One and half hours into our boat journey, as we cross the confluence with the Malinowski River, we will leave the final traces of human habitation behind. Within the 700,000 hectare uninhabited nucleus of the reserve, sightings of capybara, caiman, geese, macaws and other large species will become more frequent</div>
 </li>
 
 <li>Boxed Lunch</li>

 <li>Chuncho Clay Lick
  <div>Three hours from Refugio Amazonas, deep in the Tambopata National Reserve we will stop at the Chuncho claylick. After a brief walk (~5 minutes) we will have the chance to see dozens of large macaws feeding on the special sodium rich clays of the riverbank. The Chuncho claylick probably attracts more large macaws than any other claylick in the world and the sight of dozens of macaws taking flight is truly unforgettable. The details of our stopover will depend on the weather and the amount of macaw activity, as the birds don’t visit the clay lick when it is raining.</div></li>
  
 <li>Orientation Upon arrival
  <div>The lodge manager will welcome you and brief you with important navigation and security tips</div></li>

 <li>Overlook Trail
  <div>A three to five kilometer hike will lead us to overlooks commanding magnificent views of the Tambopata winding its way into the lowlands. The forest on this trail, regenerating on old bamboo forest, is good for Howler Monkey and Dusky Titi Monkey.</div></li>

 <li>Dinner</li>

 <li>Macaw Project Lectures
   <div>After dinner scientists will provide an in depth look at the biology of macaws, their feeding habits, the theories for clay lick use, their breeding and feeding ecology, population fluctuations and the threats to their conservation.</div></li>
   
 <li>Overnight at Tambopata Research Center</li>
</ul>
 

<ul><div>Day 3</div>
 <li>Macaw Clay Lick
  <div>On most clear mornings of the year dozens of large macaws and hundreds of parrots congregate on this large river bank in a raucous and colorful spectacle which inspired a National Geographic cover story. Discretely located fifty meters from the cliff, we will observe Green-winged, Scarlet and Blue-and-gold Macaws and several species of smaller parrots descend to ingest clay. Outings are at dawn when the lick is most active</div></li>

 <li>Breakfast</li>

 <li>Floodplain Trail
  <div>This five kilometer trail covers the prototypical rain forest with immense trees criss-crossed by creeks and ponds. Amongst the figs, ceibas and shihuahuacos we will look for Squirrel, Brown Capuchin, and Spider Monkeys as well as peccaries. TRC is located within this habitat</div></li>

 <li>Lunch</li>

 <li>Pond Platform
  <div>Ten minutes upriver from the lodge is a tiny pond with a platform in the middle. It is a great place to spot waterfowl such as Muscovy duck, sunbittern and hoatzin along with the woodpeckers, oropendolas, flycatchers and parakeets that call this pond their home</div></li>
  
 <li>Dinner</li>
 
 <li>Night walk
   <div>You will have the option of hiking out at night, when most of the mammals are active but rarely seen. Much easier to find are frogs with shapes and sounds as bizarre as their natural histories</div></li>

 <li>Overnight at Tambopata Research Center</li>
</ul>

<ul><div>Day 4</div>
 <li>Macaw Clay Lick</li>
 <li>Breakfast</li>
 <li>Terra Firme Trail
  <div>An entirely different habitat characterized by smaller, thinner trees atop hills and slopes is covered by this five kilometer trail. Saddleback tamarins are frequently found here. As we walk near the limits of the swamp we will also keep our eyes open for rare tapir tracks</div></li>
 
 <li>Lunch</li>

 <li>Palm Swamp Trail
  <div>Growing on the remains of an oxbow lake and providing both arboreal as well as terrestrial mammals with fruits throughout the year, the aguaje palms are one of the most important food sources in the rainforest. Demand for these fruits and great conditions for planting rice, makes the palm swamp also one of the most threatened habitats</div></li>

 <li>Dinner</li>

 <li>Overnight at Tambopata Research Center</li>
 </ul>
 
 <ul><div>Day 5</div>
  <li>Breakfast</li>
  <li>Transfer Boat - TRC to Tambopata River Port</li>
  <li>Transfer Tambopata River Port to Pto Maldonado Headquarters</li>
  <li>Transfer Puerto Maldonado Headquarters to Airport
   <div>We retrace our river and road journey back to Puerto Maldonado, our office and the airport. Depending on airline schedules, this may require dawn departures</div></li>

  <h2>The famous Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu is named among the top 25 best excursions in the world by National Geographic Adventure Travel Magazine. </h2>
  
<p class="snippet">The Salkantay Trek is an ancient and remote footpath located in the same region as the Inca Trail where snowcapped mountains collide with lush tropical rain forests.</p>

<div class="snippet extended">

<ul><div>Day 1</div>
<li>We pick you up at your hotel in Cusco
 <div>and drive to the airport for the 35 minute flight to a small airstrip cut into the rainforest at Boca Manu. On arrival at the airport you will be met by your rainforest guide. Our motorized dugout will take you on the two hour (approx) trip down the Madre de Dios River to the Manu Wildlife Center, a strategically located lodge owned by Manu Expeditions and a local conservation group. On the river journey we will see our first Amazonian wildlife and riverside birds such as Skimmers, Terns, Herons, Egrets and Orinoco Geese. We should arrive at the lodge for lunch and meet some of the visiting biologists working here. In the afternoon we explore a trail that leads out to a lookout point high above the river to watch roosting flights of Parrots as the sun sets, and we may encounter a troop of monkeys in the forest. Those who wish can do a night walk with the guide in search of nocturnal inhabitants of the forest. Night Manu Wildlife Center</div>
 Lunch and dinner included.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><div>Day 2</div>
<li>Early start to-day for the Macaw Clay Lick
 <div>This is truly one of the world’s great wildlife spectacles as hundreds of Parrots and their larger relatives, the Macaws, congregate at this traditional locality to eat the mineral rich clay that is essential to their digestion. We'll use a blind (hide) to get close to the birds. The noise alone is incredible and the sight of these brightly colored birds at the lick is a sight not to be forgotten. As the lick slows down in midmorning we'll head for Cocha Blanco, an old, ox-bow lake, in search of a family of Giant Otters that live there, and canoe around the lake on our floating platform looking for other wildlife. After a leisurely lunch at the lodge we'll explore other trails in search of Emperor and Saddleback Tamarins, and we have seen the rare Goeldi's Monkey repeatedly in this area. Night at the Manu Wildlife Center B:L:D</div>
 Breakfast, lunch and dinner included.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><div>Day 3</div>
<li>Full day to explore the forest and trails around the lodge
 <div>We'll be on the lookout for Monk Saki - an uncommon and rarely seen monkey of the tierra firme forest that is occasionally seen here. We'll explore trails where groups of Manakins , perhaps the most enigmatic of neo-tropical birds, perform their strange mating dances and walk to one of our blinds at a large mammal lick where Guans and forest Parakeets and Parrotlets come for clay. Here too, groups of Black Spider Monkeys visit on occasions for clay to help their digestion. Those who wish will return with the guide to the lodge in the late afternoon, however there is an opportunity to stay at the lick after dark until midnight to see what nocturnal creatures come to the lick. Tapirs, the largest South American land mammal are frequent visitors with up to 12 animals visiting in one night Other nocturnal creatures are always possible. Night at the Manu Wildlife Center</div>
 Breakfast, lunch and dinner included.
</li>
</ul>

<ul><div>Day 4</div>
<li>After breakfast we head upriver (about 2 hours) to the small airstrip at Boca Manu
 <div>Early morning flocks of birds pass over the boat, and we may see a Capybara, the world’s largest rodent. Arriving at the airstrip we board our aircraft for the 35 minute flight over seemingly endless rainforest and then over the Andes, passing glaciers and snow peaks to the ancient Inca capital of Cusco where our staff will be waiting to take you to your hotel</div>
 Breakfast included.
