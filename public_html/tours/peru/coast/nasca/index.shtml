  <p class="snippet">Nazca culture is world famous: Nazca Lines, polychrome pottery, a sophisticated system of aqueducts and interesting burial rituals. While the Nazca lines remain the most alluring and mysterious attraction for most travellers, many curious visitors are enjoying Nasca's other places of interest.</p>

The Ballestas Islands is considered the Galapagos of Peru for it's immense abundance of sea life and unique rock formations.</p>

        of the islands and the plethora of wildlife that it hosts. You will enjoy front row VIP seating (2 seats for one person) so you will have

  <h2>The Pampas Galeras Reserve is the focal point for conservation of Vicuña in Peru. Their fibre is considered the finest in the world. </h2>
  
  <p class="snippet">The Pampas Galeras National Reserve was established in 1967 and is a protected area of 6,500 hectares,
  but its area of influence extends over 60,000 hectares and includes a sizeable group of communities.
  The goal is community development through sustainable resource management.</p>
  <p>The International Festival of the Vicuña seeks to revive Andean culture and practices that
  utilize Pre-Inca techniques of management of these special animals.</p>
  <p>Circling the extensive highland pastures with a human fence
  around the vicuñas through music, song and spirited movements help drive the vicuña toward the corral where they are classified and finally
  sheared for fibre. Afterwards they are released without endangering their existence.</p> 
  <p>This work is characterized by the impressive array of people involved: farmers, students from schools, colleges, universities,
  national and foreign professionals and the general public. </p>
  <p>Our guided tour starts at the time organized for your guide to pick you up from your hotel. the pampas galeras national reserve is located about 90 km from Nazca. </p>

  <h2>If the Nazca lines are Nasca's greatest mystery, then the Puquios (aqueducts) of Cantalloc are Nazca's greatest achievements since their construction was much more complicated and difficult.</h2>

<p class="snippet">Since Nasca's narrow valley only supported a small farming area, and with only dry desert surrounding it (one of the driest in the world), moving water from the valley was vital for the survival of the inhabitants.</p>

<p> Of 36 Puquios, most are still functioning bringing life-giving water to the desert farms and the people of Nazca - a testament to their construction over 1,500 years ago. Spanning kilometers, deep canals were excavated, lined with stone then covered with wood and buried. They have never been fully mapped nor excavated but it has been asserted that the Nazca Lines depict maps and pointers to the subterranean aquifers that feed the Puquios system. </p>

  <h2>Prehispanic mummies and ancient artifacts of great archaeological significance are found just outside of Nazca city.</h2>
  <p class="snippet"> The cemetery 'Chauchilla' was discovered in the 20s but has not been used since the 9th century. The site holds important burials over a period of 600 to 700 years beginning around the year 200 AD and offers important insight into Nazca culture.</p>
  <p class="snippet">A very dry climate in combination with Nazca funeral rite procedures has preserved the mummies so well that many still maintain hair and skin. The site is highly interesting archaeologically and is a recommended visit for those who appreciate archaeology.</p>
