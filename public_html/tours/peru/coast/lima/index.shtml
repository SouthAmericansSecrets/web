  <h2>The Oldest Civilization of Americas</h2>
  <p class="snippet">For those with a keen interest in archeology and adventure, the tour embarks from Lima via the Ruta del Sol (just around 2 hours) enroute to discover the Norte Central civilization.</p>
  <p class="snippet">Also known as Caral or Caral-Supe, the Norte Central civilization was a complex Pre-Columbian society that spanned nearly 30 major population centers in what is now known as the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru.</p>
  <p class="snippet">The oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of six sites where civilization separately originated in the ancient world, Caral flourished between 3000 BC and 1800 BC. It's derivative name, Caral-Supe, is born from Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and significantly studied site in Norte Chico. Complex society in Norte Chico emerged just a millennium after Sumer in Mesopotamia, around the same time as the pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Norte Chico predates the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.</p>

  <div class="snippet extended">
   <p>Caral was discovered in 1948 but received little attention until an archaeologist named Ruth Shady further explored the 5,000 year-old city of pyramids in the Peruvian desert with its elaborate complex of temples, amphitheater, and ordinary houses. The urban complex is spread out over 150 acres (607,000 m²) and contains several plazas and residential buildings and indicates that Caral was a thriving metropolis at approximately the same time that Egypt's great pyramids were being erected.</p>
   <p>The Caral tour is a full day leaving early from Lima and returning late  afternoon. South Americans' Secrets arranges visits to the area with professional tour </p>
   <p>guides or, for those with a special interest in archeology, we can offer local archaeologists who can offer specific and academic information about this interesting ancient city.</p>

  <p class="snippet">These two museums house incomparable artifacts and collections of pre-Colombian art from Peru and the New World and are, arguably, the most important museums in South America.</p>
  <p class="snippet">Larco Museum is housed in a unique colonial residence dating back to the 17th century and built atop a pyramid of the 8th century. This fabulous museum includes an exquisite collection of Peruvian gold and silver from the ancient Incas. It also hosts a pre-Hispanic erotic art salon. Its over 45,000 archaeological pieces, classified by renowned specialists and scholars, tour major world museums regularly. Larco is among only a few museums around the world opening their vaults to the public and can boast that it exhibits the largest private collection of pre-Colombian Peruvian art in the world.</p>
  <div class="snippet extended">
<p>The National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History, also housed in an old Colonial mansion, was formerly the residence of Peru’s viceroys, then of its liberators. In this, Peru’s grandest museum, you find the Estela Raymondi and Tello Obelisk monuments - carved stone pieces dating back to the Formative period over three thousand years ago. The museum also features the largest textile collection, with fabrics from the Pre-Ceramic period through the Inca Empire, and a major collection of Ancient Peruvian metals. And the impressive Tawantinsuyo Room illustrates one hundred years of the Inca Empire through virtual models and re-creations.</p>
