  <h2>Travel through the winery valleys of Ica, a landscape of extreme contrasts where wine and pisco are produced in the traditional way since the colonial era.</h2>

  <p class="snippet">The city of Ica is located between drifting sand dunes and the western dry Andes. It's geographical location within the valley guarantees dry and sunny weather year round - perfect for growing grapes, asparagus, paprika, and cotton.</p>
  <p class="snippet">Huacachina, a small tourist village surrounding a large oasis, is just 5 km south west of Ica 
      and a great hiding place for foreigners to stop, relax and practice the best sand boarding in the world. If you're not into extreme sports, visiting the vast mountainous dunes surrounding Huacachina by dune buggy is spectacular enough on it's own 
      and a must see if you&#39;re passing through the region.</p>
