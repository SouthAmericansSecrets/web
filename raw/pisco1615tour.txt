The vineyard was originally part of the old Hacienda of Santa Cruz de Lanchas in the sixteenth century, raen by the Jesuit order which was principally engaged in grape harvest, production and sale of pisco during the colonial period.

Now over 20 years old, and given their particularly privileged climate and the use of technology in vineyard management and fermentation process allows this vineyard to offer perhaps the best pisco in the world.


Peruvian Pisco
A spirit obtained by distilling fresh grape musts recently fermented, using methods that maintain the traditional principle of quality. Pisco is the only spirit in the world made exclusively from pure grape juice or must without adding water or aged in oak, so it maintains the varietal qualities of the grapes from which it was made.
